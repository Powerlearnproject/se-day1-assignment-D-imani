Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is a branch of engineering that deals with the development of software products.
- It is important as it leads to the creation of various softwares that aid in different aspects of modern life, example in medicine and education.

  
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- The development of key programming languages such as Autocode and FORTAN
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
- The rise of agile and structured methods of software development in the 1970's


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning and requirement analysis. Defining of requirements Here all requirements for the target softwares are specified. It is usually done through Software Requirement Specification(SRS) document consosting of all the product requirements to be designed and developed.
- Designing At this stage the SRS document is the reference and multiple designs for the product are created at this statge and documented in the Design Document Specification.
- Development. Here, the development for the product begins.
- Testing. The testing of the product happens at this stage. It consists of reporting product defects, fixing them, tracking them and retesting them till quality standards are met.
- Deployment. Once the product is ready, it is then released to the market at this stage.
- Maintenance. Here suuport is provided and any enhancement to the software happens here after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-In the waterfall model, the process of software development is divided into separate phases, and for each step to move to the next step, the previous step MUST be complete, they cannot overlap. 
- In the agile model, the tasks are divided into small time frames to deliver specific features for a release, all the builds are incremental in terms of features, the final build holds all the features specified by the customer.
- Agile development is preferred when the project consists of a lot of developments, while the waterfall model is preferred when the project consists of a clear plan without many developments.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
- A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
- Project manager oversees the executing, planning and implementation of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) proivde tools for writing, debugging and testing code. Examples, Pycharm, Codeblocks.
- Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes to software code and coordinate work among team members. Examples, Git, Subversion 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight deadlines. This can be overcome by prioritizing the important tasks and ensuring their completion on time. Also by avoiding procrastination of tasks.
- Rapid advancement in technology which can lead to a lot of pressure . This can be overcome by constant learnng to stay upto-date with the technologies.
- Changing requirements, this can lead to difficulty in designing software that meets the requiremnts of the user. To overcome this, there has to be good communication between the users and the software developers.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing. This a method of testing units or individual components of a software application.
- Integration testing - Here different units are tested on how they interact with one another.
- System testing- This one evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.
- Acceptance testing - This is a type of testing used to determine the compliance of the system with the business requirements and asses whether it's acceptable for delivery or not.
Testing is important as it helps maintain quality of softwares.
It also helps identify and fix defects early in the development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- This is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from Artificial Intelligence(AI)

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- An example of a vague prompt: Generate a speech for me.
- An exmaple of a good prompt: Generate a speech to be used in an opening ceremony of a jewelry business
